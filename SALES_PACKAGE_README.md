Subject: [Hotel Name] - Save $[Amount] in OTA Commissions

Dear [Name],

I noticed [Hotel Name] uses Booking.com for online reservations. 
That's costing you 15-25% per booking in commissions.

Our hotel management software can help you capture direct bookings 
at 0% commission. Prestige Hotel in Ghana is already using it to:

✅ Process online bookings 24/7
✅ Accept mobile money payments (if relevant)
✅ Automate confirmations and emails
✅ Keep 100% of booking revenue

Quick ROI calculation for your hotel:
- Average booking: $[amount]
- Monthly bookings: [number]
- OTA commission (20%): -$[loss]
- With our system: $0 commission
- Annual savings: $[savings]

Can we schedule a 15-minute demo?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Contact]

## 💡 Objection Handling

### **Common Objections & Responses**

**"We're happy with Booking.com"**
→ "That's great! You can use both. Keep Booking.com for reach, but capture direct bookings with our system to save 15-25% commission. Even 20% direct bookings means significant savings."

**"It seems complicated"**
→ "I understand. That's why we provide training and support. Prestige Hotel staff learned it in just 2 days. Plus, think of it as learning once vs. losing 20% commission forever."

**"We don't have technical staff"**
→ "You don't need any! We handle setup, and daily use is simple – like using Facebook or Gmail. We provide training and ongoing support."

**"The upfront cost is too high"**
→ "Let's calculate your ROI: [Show commission savings]. You'll break even in 3-6 months, then save thousands every year. It's an investment, not an expense."

**"What if it doesn't work?"**
→ "It's already working at Prestige Hotel processing real bookings. Plus, it's open-source – you own the code. And we provide support to ensure success."

**"We need [specific feature]"**
→ "Great question! [Check HOTEL_MANAGEMENT_SOFTWARE_FEATURES.md]. Yes, we have that in Section X. If not, our modular architecture allows custom development."

**"Can we think about it?"**
→ "Of course! While you consider it, you're still paying 15-25% commission on every booking. How many bookings is that per month? [Calculate lost money]. Can I schedule a follow-up for next week?"
