## 📊 ROI Calculator

### Example Scenario
```
Hotel Details:
- Average booking value: $1,000
- Monthly bookings: 50
- OTA commission: 20%

Monthly Analysis:
OTA Commissions Lost: $1,000 × 50 × 20% = $10,000/month
Annual Commission Loss: $10,000 × 12 = $120,000/year

Our Solution:
Setup Cost: ~$2,000 (one-time)
Monthly Hosting: ~$100
Annual Cost: $2,000 + ($100 × 12) = $3,200

Net Savings Year 1: $120,000 - $3,200 = $116,800
Every Year After: $120,000 - $1,200 = $118,800
