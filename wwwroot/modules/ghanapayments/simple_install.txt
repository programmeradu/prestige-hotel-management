   (typically C:\xampp\htdocs\prestashop)

2. Create a new folder called "ghanapayments" in the modules directory:
   C:\xampp\htdocs\prestashop\modules\ghanapayments

3. Copy all files and folders from this directory to the new folder you created

4. Log into your PrestaShop admin panel

5. Navigate to Modules > Module Manager

6. Find "Ghana Payments" in the module list and click Install
